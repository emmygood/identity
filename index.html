    <section id="about">
        <h2>est. 2003</h2>
        <p>Here at 'Identity' we believe that being comfortable and happy in how you express yourself to others helps us to be the most authentic version of ourselves.
            <br>
            We pride ourselves with the knowledge that a haircut or colour change can majorly boost your confidence - and our clients will agree.
            <br>
            We are an all inclusive salon - meaning that we offer haircuts to any member of LGBTQ+ community as well as gender-affirming haircuts - to a lot of people their hair is a huge part of who they are.
            <br>
            We care because you do. Visit our salon in London today.
