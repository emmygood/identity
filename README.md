## Introduction
Identity is a site about a London hair salon that caters to an LGBTQ+ audience. The site offers a friendly welcome to those who wish to be their authentic true selves in a safe and friendly environment without intimidation; which to most is paramount. The site showcases the styles it offers as well as the ease of choosing what service they which to receive, and easy to follow booking system. 

## UX
### Color Palette


Identity is a site created for inclusion. Therefore I have taken inspiration using certain colors from the non-binary flag; yellow and black. Representing gender without reference to the binary and lack of gender. I then chose yellow to be the main color of the text throughout the body, contrasting to the dark grey, as it's associated with happiness and hope.
I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/292924-3e3e37-ffdd00-ffeb66) to generate my color palette.

### Typography


[GoogleFonts.com](https://fonts.google.com/?query=com) was imported to select all the fonts. With sans-serif as a fallback for both 'Comfortaa' and 'Rubik'. These two fonts are similar but pair together nicely.



- [Comfortaa] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa?query=com) Was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Rubik] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik?query=rubik) Was used for all the secondary text.

- [Font Awesome] (https://fontawesome.com) Was used throughout the site such as the logo, address pin, booking form, phone number, and social media icons in the footer.
