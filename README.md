## UX
### Color Palette


Identity is a site created for inclusion. Therefore I have taken inspiration using certain colors from the non-binary flag; yellow and black. Representing gender without reference to the binary and lack of gender. I then chose yellow to be the main color of the text throughout the body, contrasting to the dark grey, as it's associated with happiness and hope.
The yellow contrasts against the dark grey nicely, making it easily readable.
I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/292924-3e3e37-ffdd00-ffeb66) to generate my color palette.

### Typography


[GoogleFonts.com](https://fonts.google.com/?query=com) was imported to select all the fonts. With sans-serif as a fallback for both 'Comfortaa' and 'Rubik'. These two fonts are similar but pair together nicely. I wanted to opt for something simple and easy to read, for accessibility, but also choose something a little bit 'different'.

- [Comfortaa](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa?query=com) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik?query=rubik) was used for all the secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) was used throughout the site such as the logo, address pin, booking form, phone number, confirmation page, and social media icons in the footer.

## Features

### Common Features

#### Navigation Bar
- The navigation bar is common across all pages. Including 'Home', 'Gallery', and 'Booking'. These links are in convention with the logo, which situates itself on the left and the navigation links to the right. These then become responsive depending on the users screen size.
- The three links are easily accessible on all pages, to browse the site with ease.
- The Logo - which includes a font awesome icon - is a clickable link, providing a shortcut which will take the user back to the homepage if needed. 
- The icon next to the logo helps the ser to gain a quick understanding of what the site is about.
- To let the user know visually what page they are currently on, a line appears underneath the text, as well as when they hover over it. The color of this is in keeping with the color of the text.

### Hero Image
- The hero image is only visible on the homepage. The image is in black and white so it doesn't distract from the text.
- Because the image is not in color, the hair itself is what creates a dramatic feature; which is the goal.
- It contains a cover text overlayed in a transparent box which gives a brief summary to the user what the site is about. This box is on the right when shown on desktops but becomes responsive when shown on smaller screens.

![screenshot](documentation/heroimg.png)

### Footer 
- The footer is a common feature which is visible on all pages. It contains three social media clickable icons, which provide visible cues to prompt the user to click on the social media platforms related to Identity.
- These links are kept out of the way of the main features on the site, but remain in the same spot on all three pages, which gives the user easier access to find them.
- The lower part of the footer contains the copywrite information, which when clicked takes you through to my github profile.

![screenshot](documentation/footer2.png)

### Salon Ethos Feature
- At the top of this section is when the salon was established.
- In the salon ethos section this describes the main ethos of the salon in more depth. Providing the user with information as to whether they would be interested in visiting. This is situated on the left.
- Next to the text, is a photo of inside the salon, providing more information to the user.
- This section's background color is #292924; the darker of the grey. Which helps break up the sections.

![screenshot](documentation/about.png)

### Opening times and service prices
- This section is split into two halves; on the left you have the opening times, and on the right you have the service prices.
- By using a background image behind opening times, this helps to create a divide between the two sections. 
- I have also added a transparent layer over the image so the text is more readable.
- These are shown on the homepage in order for the user to have immediate access to what the salon offers.

![screenshot](documentation/opening.png)

### Address and Google Map
- This contains the salon address, with the Google Maps location underneath.
- This is on the homepage as it is one of the first things the user would be looking for.

![screenshot](documentation/address.png)

### Gallery Feature
- The gallery page offers users to view past work through these professional photos as well as in salon.
- This is in the format of a masonary gallery, so the user can see more than one photo without having to scroll too far down the page.
- This allows the user to see what is in offer at the salon.
- These images will display one at a time in a column when the user is using a phone.

![screenshot](documentation/gallery3.png)
![screenshot](documentation/gallery4.png)

### Booking form
- The booking page provides a phone number as alternative contact.
- The booking form asks users to follow easy to understand steps.
- Each input box text goes from black to white when the user hovers over each input field.
- The user is asked for their: name, phone number, email address, date and what service.
- There are two radio buttons asking if they've been their before.
- When the user has completed the form they will taken to a confirmation page.

![screenshot](documentation/bookform.png)

### Confirmation page
- Once the user has filled in the booking form they will be redirected to a confirmation page, so they know their booking was a success.
- This has the same stylings of the booking page, to keep things streamlined.
- A font awesome icon is used here.
- After 10 seconds, they will then be redirected back to the homepage.

### Future Features
- New feature #1
  - More photos added to the gallery.

- New feature #2
  - A page where users can virtually shop for hair care products.

- New feature #3
  - When booking in, for there to be a option to sign up for a monthly newsletter with offers on services and prodcuts.

# Testing 
I have tested the website on a variety of different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and screen sizes (laptop, desktop, smartphones). As well as testing the site with development tools, whilst building, to ensure the responsiveness across different screen sizes.

## HTML Validation

- I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.



* Home  - Pass: No Errors [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Femmygood.github.io%2Fidentity%2Findex.html) - link here

![screenshot](documentation/validation/hometest.png)


* Gallery - Lack of headings h2-h6 [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Femmygood.github.io%2Fidentity%2Fgallery.html) - link here

I am aware of this warning, however this gallery section of this page does not need any headings as there are only images. This does not effect the final look of the site in the browsers.

## Responsiveness


- I have used the Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool to make sure the site is accessible for all. 
All pages passed with no errors. Here are the results below. [Link to all pages](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://emmygood.github.io/identity/)

  - Home page - [Wave-link](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://emmygood.github.io/identity/index.html)

  ![screenshot](documentation/validation/wave.png)

  

  - Gallery - [Wave-link](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://emmygood.github.io/identity/gallery.html)

  ![screenshot](documentation/validation/wave2.png)



  - Booking - [Wave-link](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://emmygood.github.io/identity/booking.html) 

  ![screenshot](documentation/validation/wavebook.png)

  - Confirmation - [Wave-link](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://emmygood.github.io/identity/confirmation) - This alerts me to one error, however the error is that the page refreshes back to the homepage. I have left this as it is because that is the effect that I wanted.

## Compatability
- I tested the site on my smartphone (Samsung) and was very pleased all the features responded well to the smaller screen size. As a user I was able to easily click through all the pages and fill out the booking form with no problems. It was also tested on different models of I-Phone and tablets. Here are the screenshots below.

## Lighthouse
- I generated a lighthouse reports for each page, for both mobile and desktop devices, through Chrome dev tools. Here are the results below for HOME - GALLERY - BOOKING - CONFIRMATION. For the booking and confirmation pages the scores were a little lower because of the image file sizes, so I used [Convertio](https://convertio.co/jpg-jpeg/) to make the image files smaller and this helped improve the overall performance score.
