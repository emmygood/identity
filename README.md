## Introduction
Identity is a site about a London hair salon that caters to an LGBTQ+ audience. The site offers a friendly welcome to those who wish to be their authentic true selves in a safe and friendly environment without intimidation; which to most is paramount. The site showcases the styles it offers as well as the ease of choosing what service they which to receive, and easy to follow booking system. 

## UX
### Color Palette


Identity is a site created for inclusion. Therefore I have taken inspiration using certain colors from the non-binary flag; yellow and black. Representing gender without reference to the binary and lack of gender. I then chose yellow to be the main color of the text throughout the body, contrasting to the dark grey, as it's associated with happiness and hope.
I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/292924-3e3e37-ffdd00-ffeb66) to generate my color palette.

### Typography


[GoogleFonts.com](https://fonts.google.com/?query=com) was imported to select all the fonts. With sans-serif as a fallback for both 'Comfortaa' and 'Rubik'. These two fonts are similar but pair together nicely.

- [Comfortaa] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa?query=com) Was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Rubik] (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik?query=rubik) Was used for all the secondary text.

- [Font Awesome] (https://fontawesome.com) Was used throughout the site such as the logo, address pin, booking form, phone number, and social media icons in the footer.

## Features

### Common Features

#### Navigation Bar
- The navigation bar is common across all pages. Including 'Home', 'Gallery', and 'Booking'. These links are in convention with the logo, which situates itself on the left and the navigation links to the right. These then become responsive depending on the users screen size.
- The three links are easily accessible on all pages, to browse the site with ease.
- The Logo - which includes a font awesome icon - is a clickable link, providing a shortcut which will take the user back to the homepage if needed.
- To let the user know visually what page they are currently on, a line appears underneath the text, as well as when they hover over it. The color of this is in keeping with the color of the text.

### Hero Image
- The hero image is only visible on the homepage. The image is in black and white so it doesn't distract from the text.
- Because the image is not in color, the hair itself is what creates a dramatic feature; which is the goal.
- It contains a cover text overlayed in a transparent box which gives a brief summary to the user what the site is about.

### Footer 
- The footer is a common feature which is visible on all pages. It contains three social media clickable icons, which provide visible cues to prompt the user to click on the social media platforms related to Identity.
- These links are kept out of the way of the main features on the site, but remain in the same spot on all three pages, which gives the user easier access to find them.
- The lower part of the footer contains the copywrite information.
